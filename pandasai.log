# Declare result var: type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

Q: [{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What is this data about?'}]
Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

# Write code here

# Declare result var: type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

Q: [{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Provide me Summary of FY PO by BEENU'}]
Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 [{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'give me the Cost per 1000 tokens INR ?'}]

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.


Generate python code and return full updated code:
